I enter many houses and I’m greeted by so many interested, curious, excited, loud, furry family members. From dogs, cats, even parrots and exotic birds… I love to include them in my blogs! I receive so many licks, purrs and squawks, however, sometimes it takes my furry friends a minute to warm up to me. I’ve always loved animals! So, on this Thursday morning I was lucky enough to have Miss Sadie at her mom’s piano tuning. Isn’t she cute? What a sweetheart!❤️
