I enter many houses and I’m greeted by so many interested, curious, excited, loud, furry family members. From dogs, cats, even parrots and exotic birds… I love to include them in my blogs! I receive so many licks, purrs and squawks, however, sometimes it takes my furry friends a minute to warm up to me. I’ve always loved animals! This past Thursday, I was lucky enough to have Sadie at her mom’s morning piano tuning. What a sweetheart!❤️
