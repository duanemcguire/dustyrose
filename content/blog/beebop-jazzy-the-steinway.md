I have the privilege of tuning my mentors Steinway Grand piano. I love his piano and I love to play on it, too! Duane and his lovely wife, Terri,  have two of the cutest dogs: Bebop & Jazzy (100% piano dogs). These two little ones welcomed me to their home & piano shop 2.5 years ago when I started training. I always receive warms licks, hugs, tail wags, and stories as they whimper them to me. I love these pups! If there’s anything that makes you feel more welcomed and loved it’s a happy dog(s).
