I have the privilege of tuning my mentors Steinway Grand piano. I love his piano and I love to play on it, too! Duane and his lovely wife, Terri,  have two of the cutest dogs: BeeBop & Jazzy (100% piano dogs). These two little ones welcomed me to their home & piano shop two years ago when I started training. I always receive warms licks, hugs, tails wagging and they both tell me their stories as they whimper them to me. I love these pups! If there’s anything that makes you feel more welcomed and loved it’s a happy dog(s).
