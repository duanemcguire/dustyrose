The shop really isn't large enough for the new band saw to have a permanent location on the shop floor. I built a mobile base for it using [swivel wheel hardware from rockler.com](http://www.rockler.com/product.cfm?page=2383&sid=AF660), and a couple of heavy duty casters that were laying around. The rear cantilevered wheel assembly was made from 3/4" birch plywood, and a 40mm block of pinblock material. The up-force on the rear wheels is translated into a rotational force on the steel cabinet. Thus I have a good rigid support for the 300 pounds of saw. The rear casters are set somewhat wider than the saw base for additional stability.

When I posted about the new saw, Ryan commented, "I thought you ran an all Delta shop!" In deference to Ryan's comment, I painted the rear base in "Delta grey".
