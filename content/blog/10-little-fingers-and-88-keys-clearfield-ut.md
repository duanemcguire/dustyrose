After tuning this gorgeous Wm. Knabe & Co Studio Upright piano, I had 3 very anxious, young, pianists wanting and waiting to play for me. With permission from their parents, this picture shows  a grand performance of a Blues piece called: “Light Blue.” This little Miss hit that 5th interval with no problem. Soon after, her brother and sister showed off their skills. It was a great day!
