“Free Piano,” the post says! “Hmmm” (You wonder) “what’s wrong with it?”  Plenty is wrong with it, unless you’re one of the very few rare people who find a great deal and a terrific “used-free” piano! My advice to you:  If you’re not too sure what to look for when a “free” or “used” piano comes you’re way take a professional with you to help you make that deciding factor.  
A customer of mine in Clinton, UT found a “free piano” and thought she was getting a great deal. After making a tuning appointment w/me, I made a startling discovery: 5 keys were unplayable (broken hammers, shanks, and flanges) not to mention the bottom half of this Used/Free Kawai had been submerged in water. Rusty strings and bowed soundboard! Destroyed- Love your piano. Play your piano. Please don’t abuse your piano.
