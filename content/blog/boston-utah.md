An early January morning took my piano adventures over to Washington Terrace- where I found this beauty of an antique Upright waiting for me. She hadnâ€™t been tuned in some time, but was such a doll and cooperated with me during this tuning! What a deep, rich tone when it was time to dance my fingers across the ivories! Fantastic!
