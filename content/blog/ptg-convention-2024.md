Every year the PTG (Piano Technician Guild) holds its nationwide week long conference. This wonderful training opportunity helps all that attend to better their skills, learn different techniques, and embraces the piano technician trade. I attended this year’s training conference in Reno, NV and attended many training classes. I was very impressed by the expertise of the instructors and the valuable information they shared with us!  I devoured all that I learned and what I was exposed to. I also met wonderful people throughout the nation from many different states, and from several different countries. I had a remarkable time overall! Looking forward to next year’s convention.
