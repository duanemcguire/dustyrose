“The Real Zeal” is a wonderful artistic company. I asked the owner, Bailey, if she could come up with a design for me featuring a piano and flowers. This is the outcome of her idea! Her design and painting of my request  is going to be absolutely beautiful once it’s completed. I am looking forward to the final product!  I highly recommend “The Real Zeal”-
