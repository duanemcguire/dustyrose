Sometimes a “free piano” is more than you bargain for! This cute Wurlitzer gave its new owners more than just a simple tuning- inside the piano they were gifted many objects that had fallen inside it!  This made it a headache for the new owners, and a challenge for me plucking out the debris that had fallen deep inside the piano. Sticky keys, and jammed hammers were a result of this mess.  In the end I was able to pull out 2 large paper clips, 2 nickel’s and 10 bobbie pins! No more sticky keys or hammers! Freedom rang loud after that!! Just beautiful!  Take heed in “free pianos.”
