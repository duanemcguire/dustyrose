This piano in Layton, UT surprised both myself and my customer! After investigating the inside of the piano there was presence of a past mouse or possible mice who decided to make this little piano its/their new nest. Chewed keys, chawed bridle straps, urine, and feces were visible. My customer explained to me that she had purchased this piano from a friend who had left this piano out in her garage for a few months before my customer purchased it. 
Be aware of pianos left outside in garages or basements. Mice love dark places to hide and live in- especially unattended pianos! Unfortunately, I had to walk away from this job!
