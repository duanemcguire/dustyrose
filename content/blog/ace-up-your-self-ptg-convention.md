Every year the PTG (Piano Technician Guild) holds its nationwide week long convention. This wonderful training opportunity helps all that attend to better their skills, learn different techniques, and embraces the piano technician trade. I attended this year’s training convention in Reno, NV and attended many training classes. I really appreciated the brilliant instructors. The information they shared was useful and important! I devoured all that I learned and what I was exposed to. I also met wonderful people throughout the nation from many different states, and from several different countries. I had a remarkable time overall! Looking forward to next year’s convention.
