One of my happiest memories as a piano teacher (now retired) was when an older lady  contacted me and wanted to learn how to play the piano. She mentioned to me that she was 72 years old! She was worried she was too old to learn! I told her, “You’re never too old to learn how yo play the piano! Let’s get started!!” We had the BEST time together! Lots of laughs and tears! :)
