One of my happiest memories as a piano teacher (now retired) was when an older student  contacted me and wanted to learn how to play the piano. She mentioned to me that she was 72 years old! She was worried she was too old to learn how to play the piano!! I told her, “You’re never too old to learn! Let’s get started!!” We had the BEST time together! Lots of laughs and tears! :)
