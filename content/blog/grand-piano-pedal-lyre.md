I had the opportunity to observe and learn from my mentor, Duane McGuire, how to fix a broken pedal lyre. It looked complicated at first, but after Duane explained how it worked, what was broken and how to fix itâ€¦.. it was pretty simple. With the help of his lathe, band saw, sander, and a little bit of glue-  this older lyre was up and  working once again! Ta-Da!!!!
