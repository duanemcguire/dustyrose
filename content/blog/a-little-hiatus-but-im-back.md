If you’ve scrolled thru my piano adventures/blogs you’ve probably noticed I have not been around for awhile. At all. Since last October 2023! Yep, it’s been a little quiet on the piano “blogging frontline’s!”

  A little late, however, “Happy summer 2024!!”

On that note, I decided it was time to start blogging once again and share my adventures in piano tuning/repairs. 

In my defense….. I have been very busy! And, I’d like  to send out a big THANK YOU to all my customers for welcoming me into their houses, sharing their pianos and trusting me! And, let’s not forget all your kind words & reviews! 

Let’s get this started!!!
