It was time for a Grand Piano “regulation” teaching moment on my Baby Grand. My mentor, Duane McGuire, spent an hour with me teaching and training me regarding “regulation.” This helps  improve the action of the piano, the keys, and gives me more control while playing the piano.  As always, I’m very grateful for all the help and support Duane gives me.
