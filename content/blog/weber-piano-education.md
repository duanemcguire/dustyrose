I tagged along with my mentor to Kaysville, UT to learn about an older antique Weber piano. As I watched, and listened to Duane’s diagnoses (while educating his clients) it was clear to me WHY I love what I do! There is something new to learn everyday about pianos. So much history and love goes into these musical wonders. This job is far from boring. It’s very exciting!:)
