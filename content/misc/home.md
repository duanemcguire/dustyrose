Pianos are my life, and no day is complete without playing. I tune and maintain pianos, so that each customer may find the joy in their piano that I find in mine.

How's your piano sounding? Does it need a little help? [Schedule your piano tuning](/schedule) today and fall in love with your piano again. Basic tuning services start at just $130.00. My primary service areas are Davis and Weber counties in Utah. Service outside of Davis and Weber counties will incur an additional fee for travel.
