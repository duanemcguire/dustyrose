My name is JD Kohler—I am a Piano Technician with a love for pianos. I’m located in Clinton, Utah and strongly welcome the adventures of traveling throughout Northern Utah to tune pianos for others.

As an avid piano player, I began playing at the age of 11 and understand the importance and benefits of a well-tuned piano.

Having lived a military life and raised a family, I have taught piano to all ages for over 25 years, from the USA to Okinawa, Japan..

Now retired as a piano teacher, I pursued my love for pianos even further and studied to become a piano technician; I am passionate about giving the best service to all pianos.
